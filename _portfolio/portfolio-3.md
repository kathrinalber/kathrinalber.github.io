title: "Reseach about impacts of different modes of variability on the diurnal cycle of convection"
excerpt: "In this project I am analyzing how different modes of variability like the MJO, ENSO and the IOD influence the diurnal timing and intensity of convection over the Congo.

Motivation
====

This project aims to shed light on the yet unanswered questions of how the MJO, ENSO and IOD may impact the diurnal cycle of convection over the Congo. This will provide useful information about possible causes of changes of the diurnal cycle of convection and may thereby enhance the current and limited understanding about the variability of rainfall and convection over the region. This work might also help to answer open questions about what mechanisms control variability in rainfall and convection over the region, as well as about potential driving factors of the observed drying trend. 

Project Status
