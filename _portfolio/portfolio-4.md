title: "Modeling drought impacts on the diurnal cycle of convection with WRF"
excerpt: "In this project I am investigating how the long-term and large-scale drying trend observed over the Congo Rainforest is impacting the diurnal cycle of deep convection by using the Weather Research and Forecasting (ARW-WRF) model."

Motivation
====

The goal of this work is to simulate the effects of the drying-trend observed over the Congo on the diurnal cycle of convection. My hypothesis is that the drying trend will decrease the latent heat flux and increase the sensible heat flux, leading to increased surface temperatures and decreased relative humidity near the surface. This may lead to enhanced heating and less clouds in the morning, resulting in more vigorous convection in the afternoon as well as an earlier onset of convection since the convective temperature is reached earlier.
