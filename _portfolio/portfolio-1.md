title: "Reseach on thunderstorm activity and trends over the Congo"
excerpt: "In this project I analyzed trends in thunderstorm activity over the Congo Basin since 1983. To estimate thunderstorm activity, I used the Galvez-Davison Index (GDI) which is a thermodynamic index developed at the Weather Prediction Center, aiming to forecast convection in the tropics more accurately. To calculate the GDI, I used ERA-Interim reanalysis data. I further used GridSat-B1 satellite brightness temperature where I calculated the fraction of pixels with brightness temperatures between -50°C and -70°C. This method can be used to detect cold cloud tops and to quantify thunderstorm spatial extent and intensity.  <br/><img src='/images/Schematic.pdf'>"
