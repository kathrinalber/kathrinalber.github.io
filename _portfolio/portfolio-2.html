title: "Research on the diurnal cycle of deep convection over the Congo"
excerpt: "In this project I investigated how the diurnal timing and intensity of deep convection has shifted during the past 40 years, using GridSat-B1 and MODIS satellite and ERA5 reanalysis data. I further analyzed how the changes in the diurnal cycle of convection might be related to the drying trend observed over the region. <br/><img src='/images/Fig_10_new.png'>"
