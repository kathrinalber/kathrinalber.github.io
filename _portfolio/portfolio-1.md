title: "Reseach on thunderstorm activity and trends over the Congo"
excerpt: "In this project, I analyzed trends in thunderstorm activity over the Congo Basin since 1983. To estimate thunderstorm activity, I used the Gálvez-Davison Index (GDI), which is a thermodynamic index developed at the Weather Prediction Center, aiming to forecast convection in the tropics more accurately. Furthermore, I used the GridSat-B1 satellite cold cloud fraction to represent areas in which deep convection occurs. To do so, I calculated the fraction of pixels with brightness temperatures between -50°C and -70°C from the GridSat-B1 satellite dataset. This method can be utilized to detect cold cloud tops and to quantify thunderstorm spatial extent and intensity.  <br/><img src='/images/Schematic.pdf'>"

Motivation
====

The Congo Basin is one of the three most convective regions in the tropics and drives the large-scale tropical circulation together with the two other major convective regions, i.e., the MC and Amazonia (Webster 1983; Washington et al. 2013). However, despite the Congo’s formidable convection heating rate, thunderstorm intensity and lightning activity, the region receives less rainfall than the Amazon or the MC (Adler et al. 2017), while the mean precipitation has been shown to be decreasing further (Zhou et al. 2014; Hua et al. 2016, 2018). Counterintuitively, several studies have shown that thunderstorm activity has been increasing, despite the observed decrease in rainfall (e.g., Raghavendra et al. 2018; Taylor et al. 2018; Hart et al. 2019). Specific physical mechanisms explaining the complex relationship between tropical deep convection, surface rainfall, and an increase in thunderstorm activity over the Congo have only been incompletely identified.
The aim of this work therefore is to analyze trends in thunderstorm activity over the Congo since 1983 using the GDI and GridSat-B1 cold cloud fraction, and to further investigate potential mechanisms leading to those trends by evaluating the different sub-indices of the GDI.

Galvez-Davison Index (GDI)
====

For this study, I utilized the GDI and its sub-indices to analyze trends in thunderstorm activity over the Congo during the different seasons. I chose to use the GDI as this index aims to forecast convection more accurately than traditional stability indices like CAPE or the KI, which have shown limited skill in the tropics. In the mid-latitudes, convection can be triggered by dynamic processes (e.g., frontal systems) while tropical convection depends more on column stability and thermodynamic processes since dynamical processes are usually weak. Aiming to improve forecasts for tropical convection, the GDI was developed by the NOAA Weather Prediction Center (WPC) in 2014, focusing on thermodynamic processes more than on dynamical processes (Gálvez and Davison 2016). Additionally, the GDI consists of several different sub-indices evaluating different processes that dominate the variability of convection, e.g., the availability of heat and moisture, the stabilizing effects of warm mid-level ridges, and the stabilizing effects of trade wind inversions. Analyzing the sub-indices separately allowed me to investigate the different mechanisms and processes modulating tropical stability and associated convection and their trends separately. This method thus provides a perspective to understand thermodynamic characteristics of thunderstorm as well as profound indications of changes in thunderstorm activity by diagnosing the physical processes influencing the trends in GDI. Hence, this work helps to gain a better un-derstanding about the increasing trend in a thunderstorm activity and decreasing trend in rainfall over the Congo.
