I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences](https://www.albany.edu/daes) at the University at Albany, working under the advisement of Dr. Liming Zhou. Welcome to my website! 

My research is focused on understanding changes in deep convection over the Congo Basin, the second largest rainforest on Earth. I am interested in long-term trends of deep convection, changes in the diurnal timing, and in how modes of variability like the Madden-Julian Oscillation or the long-term drying trend are impacting deep convaction and precipitation over tropical Africa. 

I grew up in Switzerland and received my B.S. and M.S. in Geoscience with a focus on Climatology and Geography from the University of Basel, Switzerland. I was a visiting student at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, where I completed my Master's thesis titeled Prediction and Predictability of the North Atlantic Oscillation under the advisement of Dr. Kathy Pegion.

In my free time, I like to spend time outdoors, rock and ice climbing, backcountry skiing, cycling, and gardening. I am an active field member with Adirondack Mountain Rescue where I am also a technical rescue committee member. Additonally, I am a board member of the Thacher Climbing Coalition and have led climbing trips for children and young adults with the Swiss Alpine Club for several years before moving to the U.S. Besides that, I greatly enjoy snow science and avalanche research.
