title: "Reseach about impacts of the MJO on the diurnal cycle of convection"
excerpt: "For this work, I am analyzing how the MJO impacts the diurnal variations of deep convection and precipitation over the Congo using GridSat-B1 and TRMM satellite, and ERA5 reanalysis data. Additionally, I am exploring the underlaying physical mechanisms leading to the differences in the diurnal cycles of precipitation and deep convection between the MJO enhanced and suppressed phases. To do so, I am investigating variables relevant to the vertical circulation, i.e., horizontal divergence and vertical velocity, as well as relative humidity and divergence profiles. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70551479/181788590-9dd71e2a-79ce-47fc-957c-c005397c3a76.png)

Motivation
====

This project aims to shed light on the yet unanswered questions of how the MJO impacts the diurnal cycles of deep convection and precipitation over the Congo. This will provide useful information about possible causes of changes of the diurnal cycle of convection and may thereby enhance the current and limited understanding about the variability of rainfall and convection over the region. This work might also help to answer open questions about what mechanisms control variability in rainfall and convection over the region, as well as about potential driving factors of the observed drying trend. 

Project Status
====

This work is currently in progress (2021-).
